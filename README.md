# Wrecker
Voxel Engine and Game

A voxel engine (Clunker) and game (Wrecker). Written in C# with [Veldrid](https://github.com/mellinoe/veldrid), [bepuphysics v2](https://github.com/bepu/bepuphysics2), and [DefaultECS](https://github.com/Doraku/DefaultEcs)

The engine currently features
* Procedural voxel terrain (w/ place holder generation algorithm)
* Voxel editing
* Sunlight propogation and lighting
* Voxel grids as physics entities which can move throughout the world

This video demonstrates the engine's dynamic voxel entities
